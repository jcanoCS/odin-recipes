            It is important to note that the cook time for the pasta depends

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Boiling the Water</h4>
            <!-- 1. -->
            <li>
                Add the water to a pot and set to medium-high heat.
            </li>

            <li>
                While water is heating, add the salt and stir to dissolve.
            </li>

            <li>
                Wait for the water to start bubbling rapidly (almost 212Â°F). A
                lid may cover the pot to speed the process.
            </li>

            <h4>Cooking the Pasta</h4>
            <li>
                Once the water is ready, carefully introduce the pasta. Reduce heat
                to medium and stir occasionally to avoid sticking.
            </li>

            <li>
                Keep track of the time since the pasta was placed in the water.
                If the rapid boil stops, it will resume shortly.
            </li>

            <li>
                (Optional) If mixing the pasta with a sauce, pasta
                water may be used to thicken and bind the sauce to the pasta.
                Once the cook time is almost done, reserve a cup of the pasta
                water.
            </li>

            <h4>Draining</h4>
            <li>
                Once the time is up, turn off the heat and carefully drain the
                pasta onto a collander in the sink and gently shake to drain
                completely and avoid lumping.
            </li>

            <li>
                When the pasta has lightly cooled, it is ready to be combined
                with a sauce of choice or eaten as is. Please enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
