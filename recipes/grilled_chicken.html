        <!-- Recipe Description -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my favorite recipe for grilled chicken. Specifically, This
            recipe is for chicken breasts, but it can also be used for the other
            parts of the chicken (as long as they are cooked to a safe temperature).
        </p>
        <p>The secret is to brine it to obtain a wonderful texture with an even
            layer of seasoning from the inside out. Afterwards, it will be spiced
            and cooked on the grill (without overcooking) to obtain the maximum 
            flavor and maintain its <em>juiciness</em>!
        </p>

        <!-- Steps List (ordered) -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Brining the Chicken Breasts</h4>
            <!-- 1) -->
            <li>Flatten the chicken breasts with a mallet, rolling pin, or a 
                flat pan. This will ensure even cooking to avoid undercooked or
                dry areas within the same piece. Note that <strong>organic</strong>
                 chicken breasts are smaller and will cook much easier while 
                 also giving a more pleasant texture.
            </li>
            <!-- 2) -->
            <li>In a bowl large enough to comfortably hold all the pieces, add 
                enough cool water to be able to fully submerge every piece. Add the table
                 salt to the water and stir until fully dissolved (approximately 
                 1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 cups of water). If using sugar, 
                 dissolve it in the brine (approximately 1 tablespoon total). The
                 brine is the way the protein is seasoned with salt.
            </li>
            <!-- 3) -->
            <li>Once the brine is prepared, add all the pieces to the bowl and
                fully submerge. Cover with plastic wrap and leave in the fridge
                to brine. For optimal results, leave in the fridge for 1 hour (it
                 needs at least 45 minutes to brine and leaving it for longer
                    than 75 minutes could result in excessively seasoned chicken).
            </li>

            <h4>Preparing the Chicken to Cook</h4>
            <!-- 4) -->
            <li>After the chicken has adequately brined, remove from fridge and 
                drain. Pat dry with paper towls, cover, and leave at room temperature for 
                at least 30 minutes (to ensure even cooking from within).
            </li>
            <!-- 5) -->
            <li>Once the chicken has adequately remained at room temperature, lightly
                cover both sides with mayo using a brush (this will protect the 
                chicken from drying out and will prevent it form sticking on the
                grill).
            </li>
            <!-- 6) -->
            <li>If spices will be used <em>(highly recommended)</em>, add them
                to the breasts. (The spices listed in the ingredients 
                are will give a wonderful color and a sophisticated southwestern
                flavor profile).
            </li>

            <h4>Grilling the Chicken</h4>
            <!-- 7) -->
            <li>Turn the grill on and allow it to preheat for at least 15 minutes.
                A charcoal grill can be used to give an unmatched wonderful smoky flavor to
                the protein. A gas grill can conveniently be used and will still
                provide a good char.
            </li>
            <!-- 8) -->
            <li>
                Once the grill has been preheated at a good temperature (around
                400-450째F), place the breasts on the grill (without overcrowding).
                Leave for approximately 3 minutes and the rotate each piece 90째.
            </li>
            <!-- 9) -->
            <li>Leave for 3 more minutes and then flip the pieces over. After 3 more
                minutes, rotate each piece again 90째. At this point, the internal
                temperature of each piece can start to be checked with an internal meat
                thermometer.
            </li>
            <!-- 10) -->
            <li>Once the internal temperature reaches the safe and desired point, 
                remove the piece from the grill onto a heat resistand dish. Note
                that the optimal juiciest boneless chicken breast can be obtained
                from an internal temperature of 153째F that lasts at least 3 minutes,
                but always follow USDA guidelines for cooking safely.
            </li>

            <h4>Resting the chicken</h4>
            <!-- 11) -->
            <li>At this point, the chicken will release wonderful aromas and juices.
                As tempting as it may be to cut into the meat for a taste, it is
                <strong>vital</strong> to let the meat rest for at least 5 minutes.
                Fresh off the grill chicken will be hot inside and needs to continue
                to cook. This will also prevent the juices from the chicken from
                spilling out since freshly cooked meat doesn't retain its juices until
                <strong>after</strong> resting.
            </li>

            <!-- 12 -->
            <li>Following the resting, serve with your preferred sides and
                enjoy immediately!
            </li>
        </ol>
        

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            As can be seen, this recipe has more steps and labor than most. But
            every step of the way is important to be able to create
            the juiciest and most flavorful poultry product.
