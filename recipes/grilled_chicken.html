        <!-- Recipe Description -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my favorite recipe for grilled chicken. Specifically, This
            recipe is for chicken breasts, but it can also be used for the other
            parts of the chicken (as long as they are cooked to a safe temperature).
        </p>
        <p>The secret is to brine it to obtain a wonderful texture with an even
            layer of seasoning from the inside out. Afterwards, it will be spiced
            and cooked on the grill (without overcooking) to obtain the maximum 
            flavor and maintain its <em>juiciness</em>!
        </p>
