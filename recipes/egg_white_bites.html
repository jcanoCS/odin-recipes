        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These egg bites are so light and delicious and are a healthy
            alternative to fast food bought items.
        </p>
        <p>
            This recipe makes approximately 6 muffin sized bites. Egg whites are
            called, but the whole eggs can also be used, though cook time may differ.

        <!-- Steps List (ordered)-->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Preparing the Veggies</h4>
            <!-- 1. -->
            <li>If veggies are being used, dice the onions evenly and chop the
                rest. These will not only give the egg bites a beutiful color,
                but also gives them a pleasant aroma.
            </li>
            <!-- 2. -->
            <li>
                Add a tablespoon of oil to a pan, an heat for a minute. Lightly
                salt the chopped onions and stir fry them at medium-low heat until
                soft and lighly yellow. Once the onions are ready, add the bell
                pepper and tomatoes until soft and there is very little liquid
                remaining in them. Finally, add the spinach until most of the liquid
                is gone. This will prevent the egg bites from being soggy.
            </li>


            <!-- 3. -->
            <h4>Preheating the Oven</h4>
            <li>
                Prepare a water bath in the oven. This imitates a sous vide cooking
                style, which gives the egg whites a firm and delicate texture.
                What I like to do is to fill a pan halfway with water and place it in
                the bottom rack while the oven preheats. Preheat your oven to 375Â°F.
                While your oven gets ready you can prepare your muffin tins.
            </li>


            <h4>Preparing to Mix</h4>
            <!-- 4. -->
            <li>
                The egg mix is simple, it's only the egg whites with salt. What
                you can do is oil the muffin tins and then evenly distribute your
                veggies on each. Add as much shredded cheese to each tin as you like.
                Afterward you can pour the egg white mixture in (almost to the top).
            </li>


            <h4>Baking</h4>
            <!-- 5. -->
            <li>
                Place the pan in the middle rack and bake until the egg whites are cooked.
                They will be ready once firm (approximately 20 minutes).
            </li>

            <h4>Finishing</h4>
            <!-- 6. -->
            <li>
                Take the pan out out of the oven and leave to cool for at least 5 minutes.
                Once they egg white bites are cooled and firm, they can gently be removed
                from the tins.
            </li>

            <!-- 7. -->
            <li>
                If you wish, you may add chopped chives as a garnish to the egg white bites.
                At this point, they are ready to enjoy!
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            As you can see, this recipe is an easy and tasty recipe to save time in the
            morning while on the go. It is also nutritious as it contains a great amount
            of protein and a lower amount of calories than a breakfast sandwich (especially
