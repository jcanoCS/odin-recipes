        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Preparing the Veggies</h4>
            <!-- 1. -->
            <li>If veggies are being used, dice the onions evenly and chop the
                rest. These will not only give the egg bites a beutiful color,
                but also gives them a pleasant aroma.
            </li>
            <!-- 2. -->
            <li>
                Add a tablespoon of oil to a pan, an heat for a minute. Lightly
                salt the chopped onions and stir fry them at medium-low heat until
                soft and lighly yellow. Once the onions are ready, add the bell
                pepper and tomatoes until soft and there is very little liquid
                remaining in them. Finally, add the spinach until most of the liquid
                is gone. This will prevent the egg bites from being soggy.
            </li>
